            <h1>HUMUNGOUSAURS</h1>
            <p>Humungousaur is a somewhat humanoid dinosaur standing about twelve feet tall with hard skin that is colored brown on its outer side and beige on its inner side. Both Gwen and Azmuth share these traits as Humungousaur.</p>
            <h2>POWERS</h2>
            <p>Humungousaur is a massive, dinosaur-like alien from the "Ben 10" series, belonging to the Vaxasaurian species originating from the planet Terradino. With a bulky, muscular frame, tough armored skin, and sharp claws, Humungousaur possesses superhuman strength and durability, allowing him to lift heavy objects and withstand powerful attacks. His abilities extend to earth manipulation, enabling him to generate seismic shockwaves, create earthquakes, and shape the terrain to his advantage. Ben Tennyson, the protagonist, can transform into Humungousaur using the Omnitrix, a device that grants him access to the alien's formidable powers, making Humungousaur a formidable force in combat and tasks requiring brute strength and earth manipulation skills.</p>

            <h1>CANNON BOLT</h1>
            <p>Cannonbolt is a hulking, broad-shouldered alien covered in natural, yellow armor plating on his back, shoulders, and the backs of his arms. He is mostly white with black on his upper half and has four claws on both of his hands, having a color scheme and claws similar to that of a panda. Cannonbolt is covered in fur across the thickest parts of his body, while every other part except for his elbows and knees is short fur.</p>
            <h2>POWERS AND WEAKNESS</h2>
            <p>Cannonbolt can curl into a ball, encasing himself in his plating. In general, the Arburian Pelarota species mostly used this maneuver for defense, like an armadillo. However, since Ben did not know about this when discovering Cannonbolt, he weaponized Cannonbolt's originally defensive capabilities. Cannonbolt is practically nigh-invulnerable when curled into a ball. Cannonbolt is able to maneuver around his surroundings in ball form thanks to the short fur on his body, registering shifts in air and motion around him. Between that and his excellent hearing, Cannonbolt receives something akin to echolocation - giving him "eyeless" vision. Cannonbolt's bipedal form is top-heavy, making him very unbalanced and clumsy. This is because Arburian Pelarotas are made to spin, not walk.</p>

            <h1>DIAMOND HEAD</h1>
            <p>Diamondhead is a silicon-based life form. His body is composed of durable pale green crystals. He sports two crystal shards on his back and has yellow eyes and a sharp point on his head. He wears a sleeveless uniform which is black with a yellow "V" stripe on the middle of his torso.</p>
            <h2>POWERS</h2>
            <p>Diamondhead's body is composed of extremely thick organic green crystals, giving him crystallokinesis. He has the ability to manipulate the atomic structure of his physiology at will, allowing him to form his limbs into diamond weapons such as blades and bludgeons. He can also perform weapon manifestation and body alteration. Moreover, he can control all crystals he generates. Diamondhead can generate monstrous and large clusters of crystals from the ground, even from a distance. He can conjure and form walls and ramps that he can slide upon, as well as shields and helmets. Diamondhead can reshape his projectiles into limited shapes. He can also form gaping hands to capture enemies.</p>

            <h1>FOURARMS</h1>
            <p>Four Arms is a humanoid alien that is ten feet tall.He has well-developed muscles, two pairs of four-fingered arms, and red skin. A black stripe goes from his chin to his lower lip, and he has four eyes: a main pair and a smaller pair below them, while he lacks ears or nose. He has whisker-like spikes on each forearm.</p>
            <h2>POWERS AND WEAKNESS</h2>
            <p>Four Arms' most prominent ability is his enhanced strength, being able to lift several times his own weight and punch through various resilient materials with ease. Since Four Arms is one of Ben's strongest aliens in the Original Series, he relied on him the most when fighting large and powerful foes. Technically speaking, Four Arms is physically stronger than Methanosians and Vaxasaurians at base size. Four Arms' strength allows him to use anything heavy as a weapon, from big rocks he can throw several feet away, to metal beams and pillars that can be used as clubs. His great strength even extends to his jaws and bite, allowing him to bite metal and damage it.</p>

            <h1>GREY MATTER</h1>
            <p>In the Original Series, Grey Matter wore a white jumpsuit with a thin vertical black stripe down the front, his eyes were yellowish-green, his forehead had a larger version of the jumpsuit's stripe, and the original Omnitrix symbol was on his back. In Omniverse, Grey Matter now has a green jumpsuit with a black belt. His suit collar is now black, and the stripe on his head and jumpsuit are no longer present. He wears black, fingerless gloves with a green rectangle on the back. His neck is slightly longer, and his Omnitrix symbol has returned to his back.</p>
            <h2>POWERS AND WEAKNESS</h2>
            <p>Grey Matter's small size belies his great calculative and technical intellect. He can create complicated machines from spare parts, understand the function of any device at a glance, and make sophisticated repairs to complex machines (such as a warp-drive engine). Grey Matter's intellect serves as a problem solver and analytical help in difficult situations. This allows Grey Matter to think more strategically when brute force is inefficient. He is also generally knowledgeable; even if he does not know something, he can learn it very quickly. Grey Matter's small size makes him unsuitable for physical battle, so he must outsmart his enemies in a fight. Animals like dogs and cats can be a problem, as they may see Grey Matter as a chew toy or food to them.</p>

        <div  style="height: 600px; width:100%; background-image:url(../image/heat\ blast.jpg); background-repeat:no-repeat; background-size:cover; background-attachment:fixed;">
            <h1>HEAT BLAST</h1>
            <p>Heatblast is a plasma-based life-form whose body is composed of a super hot inner plasma body covered by dark reddish brown volcanic rocks. As a fire-based entity, his body radiates high amounts of heat. His feet have a slight oval-like design with only two toes and one back toe. His tongue is also made of fire while his collarbone resembles a volcano which generates a fiery "hair" that covers his head, leaving his mask-like face visible with no nose or ears. In Ultimate Alien, Heatblast closely resembled Alan, only taller, not as skinny, slightly altered and his face shape was more similar to the Original Series. His eyes were no longer connected to the fire on his head. The rocks over his body changed, with a burnt black color and red markings on every edge of his rocky skin, resembling charcoal and his plasma body is a lighter shade of yellow.</p>
            <h2>POWERS AND WEAKNESS</h2>
            <p>Being one of Ben's most versatile alien forms, Heatblast is a pyrokinetic, meaning he has the ability to generate and manipulate intense heat and fire from his body. He can form fire into any shape that he chooses, commonly fireballs that he can project from his arms and eyes.  Heatblast also has the ability to pyrokinetically make objects catch fire from a small distance away, as seen when he set Gwen's shoe on fire.</p>

            <h1>STINKFLY</h1>
            <p>Stinkfly has an insectoid body and four crab-like legs and two arms with three-clawed hands. He has four small eyes on long prehensile stalks connected to his large head, which can all be moved around independently from each other. On his back are two very fragile light greenish-yellow dragon-like wings with veins running through them, and his limbs are a brown-greenish color.</p>
            <h2>POWERS AND WEAKNESS</h2>
            <p>Stinkfly's primary ability is to squirt high-pressured streams of green, slimy liquid from the glands located inside of his eyestalks and mouth. This slime is strong enough to hold a helicopter[6] and hold down Crabdozer. Stinkfly is capable of utilizing his slime in a number of useful capacities, such as ensnaring his opponents, or blasting a stream of it out of his mouth, solid enough to pull himself upwards like a makeshift grappling hook. An opponent could take advantage of Stinkfly's wings, as if they are held down, Stinkfly is unable to fly. If his wings get completely soaked in water, they become limp and heavy and he'll be completely incapable of flight until they dry off. Stinkfly has enhanced hearing, as he was able to hear a conversation over the sound of a helicopter while both he and it were flying.</p>

            <h1>WAYBIG</h1>
            <p>Way Big is a white colossal humanoid creature with a large frill on his head, which is black at the front and red at the bottom. He has blade-like growths on his shoulders and spikes on his waist. He also has red arms with three black lines and white fins on the elbows, wristband-like outgrowths on his wrists and yellow eyes on his head with two extra eyes protruding on his cheeks, one on each. He has red feet with two toes, a black sandal-like covering on the middle of his feet and three black lines on the side of his neck.</p>
            <h2>POWERS AND WEAKNESS</h2>
            <p>Way Big can shoot a powerful cosmic ray from the outer edge of his right hand by crossing his arms together.His cosmic rays are powerful enough to overpower the Incursean Conquest Ray.Ben learned this ability by practicing as Way Big.[DM 3]In Omniverse, Way Big has two red lines on his neck, the blades on his shoulders and waist have returned and are red and he also has black fingerless gloves, similar to the ones Four Arms wears in the same series. He is now more muscular, his head is less skull-shaped and has eyes on his cheeks again, which are more metallic. The fins on his arms are longer and he has regained the stripes on his arms and legs, and the wristband-like outgrowths on his wrists. Both 16 and 11-year-old Way Big share the exact same design.</p>

            <h1>WILDMUTT</h1>
            <p>Wildmutt appears to be a large orange dog-like creature with no eyes, ears, nose, or tail. He stands on all fours and his movements are somewhat apelike. His teeth are very defined and his bottom jaw sticks out of his mouth. The various spines found all across his body function similarly to whiskers with tactile sensing, and are not fur. Since Wildmutt has no eyes, he uses his sense of smell and hearing to navigate, which are aided by three gill-like nostrils located on each side of his neck.</p>
            <h2>POWERS AND WEAKNESS</h2>
            <p>Wildmutt's main ability is his sense of smell. As he has no eyes, his "vision" is made up of a dull 3D mapping of where his senses originate, similar to a thermograph. Combined with his enhanced hearing, his senses take the form of a radar or sonar, allowing him to still perceive his environment more clearly. Wildmutt can sense invisible entities with his enhanced senses, therefore making invisibility useless against him. Wildmutt cannot talk in human languages. Instead, he communicates through a combination of barking and snarling. Due to this, it is extremely difficult for anyone to understand him. Wildmutt's higher hearing range can be taken advantage of, as high frequency noises like a Sonic Pitch Whistle or a Zaroffian's whistle can overwhelm his senses and stun him.</p>

            <h1>XLR8</h1>
            <p>XLR8 resembles a semi-armored Velociraptor. He has black orbs on his feet, a black tail with five blue stripes, and bulky claws on his 3 fingers that can only open and close. He wears a black cone-like helmet with a protective visor that slides over his face (that is part of his Kineceleran biology and not mechanical). When the visor is lifted, one can see his blue face, green eyes, black lips, and stripes running under and in between his eyes; the rest of his head's features are unknown. XLR8 wears a black bodysuit and turtleneck-like shirt with a white stripe on the center.</p>
            <h2>POWERS AND WEAKNESS</h2>
            <p>Using his enhanced speed and agility, and the ability to manipulate his friction, XLR8 can reach running speeds of 500 miles per hour. He can accelerate so quickly that time appears to completely stop to him, allowing him to change the positions of things around him mid-motion, while only being able to be seen by a camera with a very high shutter speed.</p>
